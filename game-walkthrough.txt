Walkthrough of the game.




Judge chooses a topic.

Puppies

Then, each other player submits their response.

Cute
Kitties
Dog
101
poop

Then back to the judge. The judge sees them in random order:

Dog
101
Kitties
poop
Cute

Then the judge has 6 points that they can hand out by tapping the answers.

 1 Dog
 1 101
 1 Kitties
 2 poop
 1 Cute

Then everyone sees the result:

 1 Cute		  Nancy
 1 Kitties	Allison
 1 Dog		   Lisa
 1 101		   Hallie
 2 poop		  Kelley

Then repeat, with the judge rotating, ending after the first complete round in which someone goes over 10 points.
